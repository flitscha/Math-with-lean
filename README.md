# Math with Lean

This repository is dedicated to expanding my knowledge of Lean and proving mathematical statements from my studies.

## About Lean

Lean is a functional programming language designed to formalize mathematical concepts and verify proofs. In Lean, mathematical statements are represented as data types. By creating a function that maps one data type to another, you construct a proof: you assume the first statement to be true and prove the second.

## Contents

I'll probably focus mostly on algebra here. There is a definitions.lean and theorems.lean file per chapter.

## Contributions

Suggestions, improvements, or discussions about the proofs are welcome. Please open an issue or submit a pull request.
